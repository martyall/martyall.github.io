# Contracting Services

I am available for both contracting and consulting services for a variety of software projects, especially in blockchain development and web development. I have over 6 years of professional work experience as a Haskell and PureScript developer, and over 5 years of professional work experience in blockchain development. See my [open source](./open-source-work.html) page for a list of personal contributions in this direction.
