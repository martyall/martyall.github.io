# About

I'm a senior software engineer working primarily in statically typed functional programming languages. I have extensive experience developing stream-processing pipelines and backend web services in Haskell. I have authored many open source libraries and tools for developing blockchain applications in Haskell and PureScript. I also build frontend applications in PureScript, including a widely used public Ethereum application.

In the last two years I have also worked extensively on numerical analysis pipelines to derive accurate localization data from raw GPS/pseudorange measurements produced by a custom hardware stack at my previous company. This work is not yet open source, but I'm hoping it will be soon.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was a PhD student in pure mathematics. My areas of research interest were in Algebraic Geometry and Complex Geometry.
