# About

I'm a senior software engineer working primarily in statically typed functional programming languages. I have extensive experience developing stream-processing pipelines and backend web services in Haskell. I have authored many open source libraries and tools for developing blockchain applications in Haskell and PureScript. I have also built and contributed to several large frontend applications in PureScript, including Ethereum applications.

My current area of interest is in ZK protocols, specifically the mathematics behind it and the languages which are friendly for arithmetizing computation. My current employment is as a scala backend engineer at a webservices company. When I'm not doing either of these things I'm most likely out trail running in the mountains in Oregon.

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I was a PhD student in pure mathematics. My areas of research interest were in modern algebraic geometry. I wrote a [masters thesis](./assets/pdf/thesis.pdf) but left couple of years later to pursue other interests.
